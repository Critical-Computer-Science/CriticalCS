# CriticalCS
Repository for all things Critical CS research!

Content will be divided first by semester (not including semesters prior to Spring 2020. Earlier semesters can be found in "Archive"), then by group, and then as each group sees fit. Dividing by semester and by group will be done via branches. After that it is up to each group to decide if they want to use branches or folders, but please clearly label which method will be used.

If you create a new branch or a new folder, please add a README that explains how the folders and files are organized and what is in that folder.
