# CriticalCS
Repository for all things Critical CS research!

Content will be divided first by semester (not including semesters prior to Spring 2020. Earlier semesters can be found in "Archive"), then by group, and then as each group sees fit.

If you create a new branch or a new folder, please add a README that explains how the folders and files are organized and what is in that folder.
